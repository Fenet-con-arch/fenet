        Although digital transformation will vary widely based on organization's specific challenges and demands, there are a few constants and common themes among existing case studies and published frameworks that all business and technology leaders should consider as they embark on digital transformation. Although technology will play an important role in driving digital transformation strategy, the work of implementing and adapting to the massive changes that go along with digital transformation falls to everyone. For this reason, digital transformation is a people issue.
        For instance, these digital transformation elements are often cited: Customer experience, Operational agility, Culture and leadership, Workforce ennoblement, Digital technology integration.
